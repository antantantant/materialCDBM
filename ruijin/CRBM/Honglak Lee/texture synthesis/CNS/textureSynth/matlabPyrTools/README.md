Overview
--------

SEPSPYR is a matlab toolbox for building and reconstructing separable quadrature steerable pyramids.

This toolbox provides the following methods

* sepspyr.filter: 9 and 13 tap inphase and quadrature separable filters
* sepspyr.build: decompose and image into a separable steerable pyramid for a given number of orientations and scales
* sepspyr.steer: steer a given level of the pyramid to a specific orientation
* sepspyr.reconstruct: reconstruct an image from a sepspyr decomposition
* sepspyr.show: a visualization tool
* A demonstration highlighting common usage patterns
* A comparison to Simoncelli's excellent matlalbPyrTools for steerable pyramid reconstruction
